# Selenium Features Demo
This file is for the purpose of demonstrating some features of Selenium to the class of "Software Testing", held on semester 99-2 at Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

Feel free to clone the repo and start your journey with Selenium web driver! Happy web scraping!

P.S. For the sharif CW enrollment testing part (04_headless_example), you should have a `config.ini` file containing the account credentials. You can simply make a copy from `config.example.ini` file and rename it.
